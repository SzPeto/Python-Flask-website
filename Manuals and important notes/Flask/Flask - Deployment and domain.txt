Deployment Pre-Launch Checklist


========================================================================================================================
                           Quick manual for domain connection (checklist after this manual)
========================================================================================================================

If you deploy on render.com:
    Procfile (it should be Procfile as it is without extension in the root folder, where the run.py is run:app - run refers to run.py and app to the app = create_app() variable)
        web: gunicorn run:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT"
    
    Build command on render:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    Start command on render:
        gunicorn run:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
    
    Connecting the deployed website with domain on cloudflare:
        https://render.com/docs/custom-domains
        (On render : select the deployed website, settings/custom domain/add custom domain, add mydomain.com and then save)
        https://render.com/docs/configure-cloudflare-dns
        (On cloudflare : SSL,TLS/overview - this should be set to full)
        (On cloudflare : DNS/records/add record, you should create 2 records : 
                         1. Type : CNAME, Name : @, Content : mysite.onrender.com, Proxy status : DNS only, TTL : Auto
                         2. Type : CNAME, Name : www, Content : mysite.onrender.com, Proxy status : DNS only, TTL : Auto)

Flask:
    In root\run.py
        from website import create_app, port
        app.run(host = "0.0.0.0", debug=False, port=port) - if you deploy on render, render provides a port itself
    In root\website\__init__.py
        port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 10000)) - here it gets the PORT variable from render env, and fallback is 10000


========================================================================================================================
                                     Checklist, from most to least important
========================================================================================================================

Security
    Secrets and Configuration
        Ensure all secret keys (e.g., SECRET_KEY) are set securely and not hardcoded
        Verify environment variables are used for sensitive info (API keys, DB passwords)
        Confirm debug mode is OFF (e.g., Flask DEBUG = False)
        If using render, set the port to 10000
        Install gunicorn (pip install gunicorn) 
        pip freeze > requirements.txt - before you do this, ensure the default venv is set to this directory : 
                                        .venv\Scripts\activate - in powershell
    Authentication and Authorization
        Confirm strong password policies and hashing (bcrypt or better)
        Verify login rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks
        Check session management settings (secure, HttpOnly cookies, expiration)
        Ensure HTTPS is enforced (SSL certificates installed and redirect enabled)
    Input Validation and Sanitization
        Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS)
        All forms use CSRF protection (e.g. Flask-WTF or `{{ form.csrf_token }}`)
    Logging and Monitoring
        Confirm sensitive info is NOT logged (passwords, secrets)
        Ensure logging is properly set up to capture errors and suspicious activity
        Verify monitoring and alerting systems are in place for uptime and security
    Template security
        JavaScript → escaped with `|escape`
        HTML attributes → escaped with `|escape`

Functionality
    Core Features
        Test all main user flows manually (login, registration, logout, password reset)
        Verify error messages are user-friendly and do not leak sensitive info
        Confirm email notifications (if any) are configured and working
    Data and Database
        Check database migrations are applied and backups are scheduled
        Verify data validation on both client and server side
        Confirm database credentials and access are restricted appropriately

Performance and Stability
    Load and Stress Testing
        Run basic load tests to confirm app handles expected traffic gracefully
        Check caching mechanisms (e.g., Flask-Caching, CDN) are configured if needed
    Resource Management
        Monitor memory, CPU, and disk usage during testing
        Verify proper handling of long-running requests and timeouts

Infrastructure and Deployment
    Environment
        Confirm deployment environment matches development/staging (Python version, dependencies)
        Check requirements.txt or equivalent dependency file is up to date
        Verify virtual environments or containers are used properly
    Deployment Process
        Ensure automated deployment or rollback mechanisms are tested
        Confirm static files are collected/served correctly (Flask static folder, CDN)
        Validate web server configuration (gunicorn, nginx, apache) is optimized

Documentation and Backup
    Documentation
        Update README with deployment instructions and environment setup
        Document configuration variables and secrets management process
    Backup and Recovery
        Confirm regular backups of database and critical data
        Test restore procedure from backups

Miscellaneous
    Accessibility and SEO
        Verify site is accessible on major browsers and devices
        Check basic SEO meta tags and sitemap are in place
    Legal and Compliance
        Confirm privacy policy and terms of service are up to date
        Ensure compliance with relevant laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
