block          Fills the full width, starts on a new line

inline         Sits inside a line (like text), only takes as much space as it needs

inline-block   Like inline, but you can set width/height

none           Completely hides the element

flex           Turns the element into a flex container â€” powerful for aligning children

grid           Turns the element into a grid container (rows + columns)

table          Makes it behave like an HTML <table> (rarely used manually)
